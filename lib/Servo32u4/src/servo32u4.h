/** \file Manages servos on up to three pins: 
 *  pin 5, 
 *  pin 13, and
 *  either pin 6 OR 12 (don't use 6 and 12 simultaneously!).
 * 
 * Pin 5 uses Timer3 and has the fewest restrictions as well as the highest precision (0.5 us).
 * 
 * The other three have potential conflicts and much lower resolution (64 us).
 * 
 * Pin 13 uses Timer4, but shares functionality with the bootloader, which flashes the LED connected
 * to that pin. So, your servo will go a bit nuts when you upload -- be careful!
 * 
 * Pins 6 and 12 use Timer4, but share the same output compare -- except that they are inverted.
 * Practically, that means you can use one or the other. Note that pin 6 is shared with the buzzer,
 * so you'll need to cut the buzzer trace if you want to use that pin and maintain your sanity.
 * 
 * If using the Chassis class, Timer4 is used for the control loop, so be sure you don't create any 
 * conflicts.
 * 
 * You can either call writeMicroseconds directly (which will make it move really fast), or
 * set the target and call update() regularly.
